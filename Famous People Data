--For this project I created a famous people database with tables containing different data. 
--Then, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table of famous actors and their age:
CREATE TABLE famous_people (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    fullname TEXT, 
    age INTEGER);

#Inserting data into "famous_people" table. 
INSERT INTO famous_people (fullname, age)
VALUES ("Tenoch Huerta ", 41);
INSERT INTO famous_people (fullname, age)
VALUES ("Lupita Nyongo", 39); 
INSERT INTO famous_people (fullname, age)
VALUES ("Dwayne Johnson ", 50);
INSERT INTO famous_people (fullname, age)
VALUES ("Letitia Wright", 28);
INSERT INTO famous_people (fullname, age)
VALUES ("Henry Cavill", 39);

#Creating the table of movies the actros have acted in and their salary. 
CREATE TABLE movies (

#Inserting data into "movies" table.

#Creating a table that connects actors who have been in movies together. 
CREATE TABLE actors (

#First, I determined the movies all the actors have acted in.  
SELECT famous_people.fullname AS Actor, 
       movies.movie_name FROM 
       famous_people JOIN movies ON famous_people.id = movies.actor_id;
       
#Next, I determined which actors have worked together in the same movie. 
SELECT a.fullname, b.fullname FROM actors
JOIN famous_people a ON a.id=actors.actor1_id
JOIN famous_people b ON b.id=actors.actor2_id;

#Lastly,  I displayed all actors age and total salary. 
SELECT famous_people.fullname, famous_people.age, 
SUM(movies.actor_salary) AS total_salary FROM famous_people
